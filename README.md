Tamawotzi

Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to them. Maybe you just aren't allowed one in your flat.

To solve these problems, I've made a JavaScript pet called 'Tamawotzi'. Copyright 2019 JB😂

Tamawotzi is great because it's made of JavaScript and can do literally anything. It doesn't have any of the drawbacks of regular pets. It don't even 💩! (no more leaving it with your mum whilst you go to school, only to return with seven poo's littered across the screen).

Tamawotzi has the following features:

You can give it a name (although Tamawotzi is such a good name, i suggest you call it that)

It can get older

As it gets older, it gets hungrier and less fit

You can walk it to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

You can feed it to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

You can talk to your Tamawotzi to see if it needs feeding or walking

If Tamawotzi gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

If Tamawotzi gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
